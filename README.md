# AVCalculator

AVCalculator is a cross-patform desktop calculator made with Avalonia framework.
The point of this project is to learn Avalonia, advanced C# techniques and use MVC
pattern in practice. 

**[Disclamer] This is version 0.8** - it new extra simple calculation core and is much less prone to error than last vesrion, but it's still WIP.
