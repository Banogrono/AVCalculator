# AVCalculator

AVCalculator is a cross-patform desktop calculator made with Avalonia framework.
The point of this project is to learn Avalonia, advanced C# techniques and use MVC
pattern in practice. 

**[Discalmer] This is version 0.1** - it is very buggy and has no keyboard support;
it'll (hopefully) come in the later update.
